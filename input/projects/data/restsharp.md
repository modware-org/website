# RestSharp

RestSharp is a lightweight HTTP client library. It's a wrapper around HttpClient, not a full-fledged client on its own.

What RestSharp adds to HttpClient:

Default parameters of any kind, not just headers
Add a parameter of any kind to requests, like query, URL segment, header, cookie, or body
Multiple ways to add a request body, including JSON, XML, and form data
Built-in serialization and deserilization of JSON and XML
