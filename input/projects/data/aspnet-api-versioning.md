# ASP.NET API Versioning

The _"Asp"_ project, more formally known as ASP.NET API Versioning, gives you a powerful, but easy-to-use method for
adding API versioning semantics to your new and existing REST services built with ASP.NET. The API versioning extensions
define simple metadata attributes and conventions that you use to describe which API versions are implemented by your
services. You don't need to learn any new routing concepts or change the way you implement your services in ASP.NET today.
