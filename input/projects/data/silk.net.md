# Silk.NET

Silk.NET is your one-stop-shop for high-speed .NET multimedia, graphics, and compute; providing bindings to popular
low-level APIs such as OpenGL, OpenCL, OpenAL, OpenXR, GLFW, SDL, Vulkan, Assimp, and DirectX. Use Silk.NET to spruce
up your games and applications with cross-platform 3D graphics, audio, compute and haptics.

In addition to 1:1 bindings, Silk.NET provides high-level abstractions over multimedia windowing and input such that
one common API layer may be used to seemlessly develop for a wide range of platforms such as Windows, Linux, macOS,
Android, and iOS.

Silk.NET is the one library you'll need to form a solid foundation to power your .NET games, game engines, scientific
visualization applications, and just about anything else that needs high-grade graphics or compute abilities!
