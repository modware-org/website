# Stride

[Stride](https://stride3d.net) is an open-source C# game engine for realistic rendering and VR.

The engine is highly modular and aims at giving game makers more flexibility in their development. It can be used to create not only games but can also serve as a foundation for apps and tools.

Stride comes with an editor that allows you to create and manage the content of your game or application visually and intuitively.
