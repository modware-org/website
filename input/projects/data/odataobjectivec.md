# OData for Objective-C

[OData for Objective-C](https://odata.github.io/OData4ObjC/) makes it easy for iOS app developers to interact with data in any OData-compliant web service. It supports metadata-aware client-side code generation and full CRUD with query. If someone exposes a data model via OData, OData4ObjC makes it easy to get that model onto your iOS device.
