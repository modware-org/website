## General news

### .NET Foundation "State of .NET" survey results

We launched a "State of .NET" survey in November that closed on March 31, 2021. Thank you to all who participated. Your feedback is very important to the .NET Foundation. This was the first survey ever done by the .NET Foundation to the .NET developer community and we will continue to do them every year going forward. The survey was conducted via SurveyMonkey. We collected 4,509 responses, analyzed all the results, read all the comments, and wrote about our findings. You can [view the reports and our insights here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/stories/SM-GDSVMB2C/) and [download the anonymous raw data here](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-marketing/blob/main/Survey/).

Those who entered to win a $250 gift certificate to the .NET Foundation Store will be notified via email if you are a winner. Thank you again for participating. 

## .NET Foundation Project Updates

### [Project Spotlight](https://dotnetfoundation.org/projects/spotlight)

Each month Project Spotlight shines a light on an interesting open source project and its maintainers. 

In March, .NET Foundation Marketing Committee member, Isaac Levin, spoke with Maintainer of the Orleans project, Reuben Bond, to talk about the work Microsoft is doing in the Microservices space with .NET.

[Orleans](https://dotnetfoundation.org/projects/spotlight?project=Orleans)

Orleans is a framework for building stateful, cloud applications. Orleans applications are composed of Cloud Native Objects which allow developers to write applications which scale from a single machine to a large cluster without modifying code. Orleans efficiently distributes these objects as your application scales and handles the complexities of distributed systems so that developers can focus on application logic. Orleans powers many services in Microsoft, including Azure PlayFab, Azure ML, Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, and backends for some of the largest Xbox games.

In April, Isaac spoke with Maintainer of the Roslyn Compiler project, Jared Parsons, and gave a little insight into how Microsoft thinks about building compilers and other language tools.

[Roslyn](https://dotnetfoundation.org/projects/spotlight?project=Roslyn)

Roslyn is the C# and Visual Basic compiler and IDE experience project. It contains the source code for all of your C# and VB experiences all the way from the core compilers, Intellisense, syntax highlighting, and edit and continue logic. Anything you want to know about how your development environment works for .NET you can see in action in this repository.
