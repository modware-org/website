## General news

### [The .NET Foundation Joins the Open Source Initiative's Affiliate Program](https://opensource.org/affiliates)
For over 20 years, the Open Source Initiative has worked to raise awareness and adoption of open source software, and build bridges between open source communities of practice. As a global non-profit, the OSI champions software freedom in society through education, collaboration, and infrastructure, stewarding the Open Source Definition (OSD), and preventing abuse of the ideals and ethos inherent to the open source movement.  The .NET Foundation excited to join the OSI and look forward to working together to support open source and building on our existing commitment to interoperability and developer education with other members of the OSI Affiliate community.

We are thrilled to welcome Octopus Deploy as a new corporate sponsor of the .NET Foundation. The addition of Octopus Deploy to our community contributes to the growth of open source projects and our growing global ecosystem. As an independent software vendor, they use a number of open-source projects to build Octopus Deploy, and a healthy open source ecosystem is essential to their mission and a core of who they are.

.NET Conf is a free, 3-day, virtual developer event organized by the .NET Foundation, Microsoft, and the .NET Community. This year .NET 5 launches at .NET Conf and we're celebrating the 10th anniversary of the virtual event with some very special guests! Over the course of the three days you have a wide selection of live sessions that feature speakers from the community and .NET team members. There are sessions streaming for 24 hours between day two and three of the conference so everyone can get involved no matter what their time zone. You can ask questions live on Twitter, join the fun on Twitch, attend the virtual attendee party where you can play trivia games and win prizes. Best of all, you can take what you learn here and be a better .NET developer.

## New Releases

### Chem4Word 2020
After many months of exhaustive beta testing, we released [Chem4Word 2020](https://www.chem4word.co.uk/).  This release owes more to the underlying technology than the new features. 

The most substantial change is the new molecule sketcher.  The [Advanced CML-based Molecule Editor](https://www.chem4word.co.uk/2020/08/30/a-new-molecule-editor-in-chem4word-2020-introducing-acme/), or ACME for short, is a completely C#/WPF-based component.  We'd been using the GPL version of iChemLabs [ChemDoodle for Web](https://web.chemdoodle.com/#:~:text=ChemDoodle%20Web%20Components%20are%20pure,your%20websites%20and%20web%20applications.) up to now, but we'd been dodging ongoing concerns over license compatibility. Eventually we bit the bullet, and wrote our own sketcher.  This is ACME in action:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10074162/91839052-54a22600-ec46-11ea-90cd-e3790eb6cec1.png)

ACME can be dropped into any WPF or WinForms application, not just Chem4Word. Anyone writing a LOB cheminformatics application could use it.  It is however limited to Windows Desktop applications.  As Chem4Word up to now has been strictly Windows Desktop, then this hasn't been a limitation.  Our calculation is that there is a lot of mileage left in the VSTO/C# approach to crafting Office Add-Ins.  Time will tell whether this remains so, given Microsoft's ever-changing developer technology story.  

Other changes would appeal to the chemist more than the informatics developer.  We now support [functional groups](https://www.chem4word.co.uk/2020/08/31/functional-groups-now-included-in-chem4word-2020/) (shorthand for predefined layouts of atoms).  We have also incorporated a unique library of 2100+ substances from essential oils.  We've also improved performance, especially during rendering.  Structures now render quicker and with much higher quality.  The new Library component showcases these enhancements beautifully:

This has been a tough release to get out, especially given lockdown and the strictures of our new way of living and working.  However, it provides a very much more solid foundation for future enhancements to Chem4Word.
