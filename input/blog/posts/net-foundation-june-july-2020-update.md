Here's the June/July 2020 .NET Foundation update. Every other month, we'll give you a quick overview of the .NET Open Source landscape, including top project news, events, community links and more.

## General news

### Board Elections Update
We are preparing for our next set of Board elections and some changes are being made to the way we conduct these elections. Namely, a Nominating Committee will solicit and accept candidate applications and vet potential candidates that will then be voted on by members. Additionally, we will begin term staggering of Board members to enhance the continuity of the organization. Please see the [election page on our website](https://dotnetfoundation.org/about/election) for more [details and information on how you can submit your nomination](https://dotnetfoundation.org/about/election/campaign)! Nominations are open now and will close on June 26th. The slate of candidates will be announced on July 7th, beginning a two week campaign period. Elections follow for two weeks using the [same system](https://www.opavote.com/methods/single-transferable-vote) as last year.

## Committee Updates

### Outreach

This month the outreach group hosted its first [remote meetup](https://www.meetup.com/dotnet-virtual-user-group/events/270931523/) as part of the [.NET Virtual Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/dotnet-virtual-user-group/). 

The .NET Foundation has been working on a new initiative to help .NET user groups go virtual with the new [.NET Virtual User Group](https://www.meetup.com/dotnet-virtual-user-group/) program! Let the .NET Foundation take care of all of the streaming so you can focus in on making your meetup awesome and enable developers around the world join in. [Submit your user group session](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-outreach/issues/new/choose), get scheduled, get promoted, and have your user group. It is a great way to engage with the broader .NET community and keep your user group going during while we are all inside.

If you are looking for awesome upcoming user group sessions from around the world? Then join the [.NET Virtual User Group today!](https://www.meetup.com/dotnet-virtual-user-group/)

Our next meeting is Tuesday, 6/16 at 3pEST/12pPST, more information will be sent via email.

## Meetups

### Looking for speakers to go deep on AWS?

Would your user group \ meetup appreciate hearing about .NET on AWS from an AWS .NET developer advocate? The team of longtime .NET developers would be thrilled to join your virtual user group to chat about the latest for .NET in the cloud. 

Here's a list of example topics:
- **Overview of .NET on AWS:** AWS has over a decade supporting .NET on the cloud. We'll provide an overview of all the support you might not know existed, such as free tools for Visual Studio, PowerShell, Azure DevOps, etc.
- **Building serverless with .NET:** The future is now for serverless, and AWS is ensuring .NET is vibrant in that future. We'll show you how anybody can get started and take advantage of the speed and ease of using serverless with .NET.
- **Infrastructure as .NET:** Why learn JSON or YAML to build on the cloud if you can just use .NET? Learn how to model and provision cloud resources in .NET with the open source AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)
- **PowerShell on AWS:** AWS supports PowerShell and makes it easy to manage your AWS resources in a PowerShell scripting environment. We'll show you all the things you can easily do on AWS with PowerShell, including native support for serverless. 
- **Something else?** What are you interested in hear about? Blazor? ML? Reach out and let us know.

You can contact the .NET developer advocacy team at **[aws-dotnetfdn-interest-open@amazon.com](mailto://aws-dotnetfdn-interest-open@amazon.com)**. Cheers!
