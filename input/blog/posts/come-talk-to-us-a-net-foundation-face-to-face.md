## Come Talk to Us!

![Face to Face Meeting](/img/f2f-long.jpg)

**Updated:** Added a second meeting for more timezones

A lot of discussion inside and outside the .NET Foundation has been going on the last two weeks. What we've heard is that there is both confusion about what the goals of the Foundation are; as well as how member projects are sheparded. To this end, we'd like to start a conversation with the community. 

To begin with, we invite you to a Face-to-Face discussions on October 27th. Richard Campbell has graciously agreed to host these events:

This discussion will be live-streamed on YouTube to be as transparent as possible. Please come and bring your questions and concerns. 

There are two times:

- 12pm ET/9am PT/5pm GMT <br/>

- 8pm ET/5pm ET/11am AET/8am AWT<br/>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGB-p-IOpJk <br/>*Note: Oceania/Asia time zones are +1 day (e.g. Oct 28th)*
 
I look forward to talking with you!
