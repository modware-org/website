## General news

### [The .NET Foundation Community Survey Launched](https://dotnetfoundation.org/about/survey?utm_source=dotnetfdn&utm_medium=newsletter)
In November we launched a "State of .NET" survey and we're encouraging everyone in the .NET community to participate. Your feedback is very important to the .NET Foundation. It will help us understand our community needs better and prioritize the work that we do. The survey will stay open until March 31, 2021 after which the results will be made public. If you complete the survey you can enter to win a $250 gift certificate (multiple winners). Please visit [our survey page](https://dotnetfoundation.org/about/survey?utm_source=dotnetfdn&utm_medium=newsletter) and thank you to everyone that has completed it already.

### [.NET Foundation YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiaZbznpWV1o-KLxj8zqR6A)
We've moved the .NET Community Standups from Microsoft over to the [.NET YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oX-DBuRG4u58ZTAJgBAeQ-t). This was based on community feedback requesting that we be more clear on separating content that's produced by Microsoft from the .NET Foundation and open source community. The [.NET Foundation YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiaZbznpWV1o-KLxj8zqR6A) will continue to broadcast and promote community virtual meetups, open source project content, and .NET Foundation-related content. We hope that this makes the channel easier to navigate. [Please subscribe!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiaZbznpWV1o-KLxj8zqR6A?sub_confirmation=1) 

### [.NET Foundation Speaker Directory](https://dotnetfoundation.org/community/speakers)
The .NET Foundation is building a [speaker directory](https://dotnetfoundation.org/community/speakers) to discover and encourage speakers from around the world as well as provide mentors for new speakers. We invite you to [add yourself to the directory](https://dotnetfoundation.org/community/speakers), act as a mentor if you'd like, and contribute to building up the global list of community speakers.

## .NET Foundation Project Updates

### [Project Spotlight - Oqtane](https://dotnetfoundation.org/projects/spotlight)

Each month Project Spotlight shines a light on an interesting open source project and its maintainers. In this iteration, .NET Foundation Marketing Committee member, Isaac Levin, speaks with the .NET Foundation Projects Committee Chair, Shaun Walker, to [talk about his project Octane](https://dotnetfoundation.org/projects/spotlight) which recently launched version 2.0 at .NET Conf 2020.

Oqtane is a modular application framework which accelerates the development of modern digital experiences. It was architected from the ground up to utilize Blazor, a modern single-page application framework for building interactive web apps with C# and .NET. Oqtane offers advanced capabilities such as multi-tenancy, a fully dynamic page compositing model, designer friendly themes, extensibility via third party plug-in modules, a headless API, and supports Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly hosting models. 

### New Projects
No new projects have joined since the last newsletter, but we have a few in the pipeline that we're excited about in the new year. 

## .NET Foundation Committee Updates

### Membership Committee
 
The membership committee has processed the full backlog of new member requests. If you're reading this for the first time, Welcome!
 
There are two other initiatives we're working on. First, we're working on defining a clear set of benefits for individuals to join the foundation. We want the foundation to provide mor clear benefits to its members. Second, we're looking at expanding what kinds of contributions should be considered to join the foundation. Our goal is to attract more members to the foundation from the .NET community at large. Follow along with our discussions at our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership).

.NET Conf 2020 was held November 10-12 and it was the largest one yet all because of our wonderful community.

Over the course of the three days there were almost 200,000 live views, 100 speakers delivered 80 live sessions, sponsors gave away $200,000 worth of prizes & free digital swag and best of all, [.NET 5.0 is released.](http://aka.ms/dotnet5)
