Are you passionate about .NET? Are you interested in helping people adopt and expand Open Source initiatives? You might be the right person to help out the Outreach Committee of the .NET Foundation. 

Our meetings are public and anyone can attend. The outreach committee is here to welcome developers of all backgrounds, education, and technology experience into the .NET ecosystem. We are here to help you organize and evangelize with your own .NET communities, opportunities, and events.

If you'd like to attend, please join us on December 14th at 3pm ET/noon PT/8pm GMT/7am AEDT on Teams at:
