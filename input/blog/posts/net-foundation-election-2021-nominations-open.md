## .NET Foundation Election 2021 Nominations are Open!

It's that time of the year again, dear friends - nominations are now open for the 2021 .NET Foundation Election! On behalf of the Board and Nomination Committee, we would like to welcome all of you to participate in whatever way you can: by [applying as a candidate yourself](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=8ru98HbNZ0mMTFCoAnRpEmp3qxxG5iNBl2dHcSfTzztUOEdKT05ENERURFFIMTFOSDU3TE81NFJDQi4u), suggesting somebody else, or simply preparing to vote and help spread the word.

As a board member, you get to influence and shape the future of one of the biggest platforms there is—.NET—and everything it entails. You won't be doing this alone. You'll be working side by side with other passionate souls on the board, committees, TSG, Microsoft, community members, and more. You can review the [expectations for board members here](https://dotnetfoundation.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/EVpjN2ykcKJGkfPjbwbTNIUB_WOVtDAEElC-xXCmEh5QzQ).

We've made a few changes over the years as we've learned and grown with the community's help, and last year we started with a staggered election to avoid swapping out everybody on the board. Therefore, this year we'll select three new board members this time around, for a period of 1 or 2 years. We also decided to introduce a [Nomination Committee](https://dotnetfoundation.org/about/election) to help with the process and narrow down the final list of candidates.

If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to the Nomination Committee, as we are here to help. As a reminder, the Nomination Committee members have volunteered their time and are not current board members or candidates.

The nomination period closes on July 23rd.
