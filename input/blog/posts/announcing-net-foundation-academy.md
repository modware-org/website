The .NET Foundation's Education Committee is happy to announce that we're launching a new initiative called the .NET Foundation Academy. The .NET Foundation Academy is a program for higher education students to learn about software development using .NET. Students will develop a project from design to deployment while applying the tools, concepts, and processes desired by high-tech employers.

## Fall 2021 Cohort - Full Stack Web Development

Our first curriculum is an online instructor-led technical curriculum focusing on full stack web development using the .NET Core framework. Students will work in teams on projects they propose, design, and implement. Our teachers supervise each team's work, provide feedback, introduce the software development life cycle and best practices, and perform code reviews. The course is a 12-week program consisting of a 2.5 hour online class with a mix of lecture and workshops each week. Students are expected to complete additional coding assignments and projects outside of class hours.
