Volosoft, always thinks of open-source first. Volosoft was established based on an open-source project, ASP.NET Boilerplate. They spend most of their time developing open-source projects and building communities, focusing on the ABP.IO platform. As a company that succeeds in building a business model around an open-source platform, Volosoft is aware that it is hard to create and maintain open-source projects.
