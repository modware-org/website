## The results are in!


We are pleased to announce the winners of the 2021 Board Election, but before we do, we have a bit of news to announce.  

Rodney Littles has decided to resign from the Foundation. Rodney has been a board member and the chair for the Technical Steering Group for the past year. We wish him all the best as he refocuses on his personal life. The bylaws of the Foundation state that the existing board should appoint a replacement for his seat. We felt with the election taking place as he sent his resignation, it would be fitting for our community of members to have a say in that 4th seat.  

The newly elected board seats will be filled by: 

<b>Mattias Karlsson</b>

<b>Frank Odoom </b> 

<b>Rob Prouse </b>

<b>Javier Lozano (re-elected) </b>


We understand there has been concern and conversations around the lack of gender and cultural diversity in the slate of candidates. There is work that needs to be done within ourselves and the .NET Community to be more inclusive without excluding the work of those that are trying to make a difference for everyone. That work will begin this week as the new board will meet with the existing board to start the hand-off process.  

Thanks to everyone who was nominated, ran, and contributed to the success of this election!
