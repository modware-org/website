With the Face-to-Face meeting coming up next week, we wanted to help get the important discussions started. To that end, we're opening up a place to put your questions and have the community vote the most important ones to ask with our limited time.

To add your questions and vote, please visit:

> https://bit.ly/dnf-facetoface

We're using this method to gather the questions that are most important to the community. This will become the list of questions from the community on the day of the Face-to-Face events. While we still will be monitoring the chat, we wanted a way for the community to help us field the right and most important questions. Please help us do that.  

Don't forget to join us for the Face-to-Face meeting on October 27th, 2021. You can join on YouTube:
