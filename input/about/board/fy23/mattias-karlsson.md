# .NET Foundation Campaign: Mattias Karlsson

## Why I'm running

The Foundation has added a lot of really important issues and tasks to its plate, but at the same time I believe it has failed with some basics like being clear of what its overall vision and goals are. It's added a lot of new projects, but after projects joined it's not been clear of what's expected of them or what they can expect from the Foundation. So I see a disconnect in expectations between the board, members, projects, and the rest of the community. A divide I would love to see be bridged.

As a maintainer, contributor, and consumer of several open-source projects for over two decades, I believe I can provide honest valuable insights and feedback on the issues and challenges experienced by the open-source ecosystem.

 I'm a firm believer that with community work, continuity is key! It's better to do a little often and in a dependable fashion, than something big on an unpredictable basis. Listening is more important than prescribed guidance.

## Who am I?

I am Mattias Karlsson, and for quite some time now I've been a developer, a maintainer, a contributor, a speaker, and an organizer within the .NET community. And somehow managed to in a continuously evolving field still be curious and passionate about it, which led to continuously adapting to and learning new things.

But beyond that, I'm most importantly a father of two and husband of one.

## Experience with the Foundation

I'm one of the maintainers behind the Cake project which joined the Foundation 2016, contributed to several member projects, participated in both group, 1:1 feedback sessions, and the first public election.


## What are my goals for the .NET Foundation?

A sustainable, welcoming, and inclusive .NET open source community.
