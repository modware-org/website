David is the founder of Electric Head Software, working as an independent software consultant based in London focusing on software delivery, developer mentoring and cultural change - mostly working with London-based organizations and start-ups.

David has previously served as the Chief Technical Architect for JustGiving, and helped market-leading organizations such as JUST-EAT, Trainline, Euromoney, Gfk and Vodafone improve their technical capabilities and culture across a variety of principal engineering and senior leadership roles. As a result of his community work, David is a Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies.

David is also the best-selling author of the book "Get Coding!" - a children's programming book available worldwide, and its successor Get Coding 2! - covering videogame programming for 9-14 year olds.

There's a chance you've seen him talk at a spread of conferences, user groups and code-dojos around the UK over the last decade or indulged in bar-room programming debates after one.

## Why I'm running

**I want .NET to be in the room.**

That sounds like a nothing statement, but it's important.

The foundation looks after one of the **most strategically important programming languages in the world**. A platform that has lived and thrived long enough to have been the cool new thing, to have been the old thing, and to be a cool new thing again.

I want .NET to be in the room when **innovation is discussed**. I want it to be in the room when people are **planning bootcamps, creating content, designing new systems**. I want it to be in the room, and more importantly, the minds of startups creating new technology deciding which platforms to support.

**.NET is a brilliant, capable, performant and leading programming stack**, and whenever people think "what are the credible choices to build our new thing in", I want them to see .NET as a contender.

The technology landscape shifts quickly, and I want to **embrace the fact that the .NET ecosystem is not an island**. .NET isn't the only option, and it's not the only good platform – and we need to **be present in the wider technology community** where people learn, and build new things, and go for support to **broaden the appeal and credibility** of the platform outside of it's more traditional userbase.

**.NET is diverse – both in target and audience**, in the kinds of software built in it, in the things that it does. The way we grow and ensure the longevity of the platform is by making it clear that **.NET is for everyone**. It's for enterprise software development, it's for games, it for IoT, it's for mobile, it's for learners, it's friendly, and it's welcoming.

I want to ensure that **humans are at the centre of everything the foundation does and promotes**. We should continue to **fund and support our open-source authors**. We should **facilitate aid and mentorship** for people looking to make a living from the software they build for free. We should act as a **hub of support** in whatever ways the community requires to make building in .NET a sustainable, appreciated, and supported endeavour.

Platforms live and die by their contributors - the **humans at the centre of everything** - and simply "funding open source" is just the start.

I want to run to help in this journey, to make the .NET ecosystem a **welcoming, regarded, and pleasant place** that people want to contribute and grow, which in turn will help curate an ecosystem that thrives as it grows and changes.


## Experience with the Foundation

- Invited to join ~2019
- Paid up voting member
- Currently mostly casual attendance


## What are my goals for the .NET Foundation?

### Clear goals and radical transparency

I would like to help the foundation clearly articulate its goals, initiatives and strategies in a way that is both **visible** to casual observers and welcoming towards outside contribution. These initiatives should be publicly tracked, and their results measured.

### Educational outreach and community growth

I would like to help the foundation find early-stage learners wherever they usually are – via **engagement with bootcamps**, learning platforms and other **education institutions** to make sure that when technology is taught, .NET is on the menu. We should **fund content and experts** to support these platforms to actively grow the community.

### Diversity and inclusion

I would like to **fund education, support and mentoring for candidates from diverse backgrounds** – to put money behind the statement that .NET is for everyone.

### Open source and author support

I would like to extend the current legitimisation and curation of open source to include a **mixture of funding and mentoring support**, to **listen to authors** about what they need and spend community funds making the lives of people actively building on .NET better.

### Listening, Patience, and Kindness

I believe the foundation needs to listen to both it's members, and the community setting a **tone of kindness, patience, and empathy as the default**. It must be prepared to not have all the answers, and to help facilitate and support when they emerge elsewhere.

"A rising tide raises all ships" - we'll grow our community and the reputation of our platform with a mix of kindness and support with humans at the centre.
