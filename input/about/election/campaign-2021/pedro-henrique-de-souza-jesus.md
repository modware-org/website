## Why I'm running

While a go I saw the results of the Participant Demographics survey made from November 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 by the .NET Foundation and the first question was `What is your gender?` And the answer `Male` is grater than 90%. With that is easy to see that our community lacks diversity. We have an environment that can run in many areas (Web, mobile, desktop, AI, IoT, etc) and platforms (Android, Mac, Linux, Windows, etc) and why we don't have a diversity community?

Diversity is the oxygen that anything needs to stay alive and creative, with diversity we can maintain our existings projects, improve them in different ways, have different points of view and create new projects and ideas.

I'm running because I want to do more about it, I want to make sure the .NET Foundation will keep moving forward to make our environment more diverse and creative.

## Experience with the Foundation

Most of my work in community happens in open-source projects, I've been maintaing and contributing with projects that are part of the Foundation. I always try to bring more people to the open-source world and also to the .NET ecosystem helping them give your first contribution and supporting the regular contribuitors.

## What are my goals for the .NET Foundation?

My dream is to make the .NET community more diverse and welcoming to all people.
