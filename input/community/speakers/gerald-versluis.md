Hi! I'm Gerald, and I write code for tech project around the world. I'm currently a software engineer at Microsoft working on GitHub Codespaces, and have worked with the likes of Azure, ASP.NET, DevOps, Xamarin, and others over the years.

When I'm not actively writing code, you'll probably find me enjoying bad memes, or making content for my YouTube channel or blog. I like to think of those as byte-sized pieces of virtual knowledge to help my audience excel in the field I love so much.

There's no motivational fluff here. No "inspiration meets innovation" type jargon. At the end of the day I'm just a guy like any other, that happens to be obsessed with what I do. And trying to tech and help others grow, hopefully with a bit of a laugh.
