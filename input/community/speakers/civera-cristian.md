My name is Cristian Civera and I've been working with .NET since the first release, developing for Windows and web. In the last years, my passion is focused on web and cloud technologies, in particular to web frameworks, such as React and Angular, and Microsoft Azure as a backend platform.
For 15 years I've been working as a freelance software architect for many Italian clients and several fields: IoT, home automation, industry automation and management system.
I'm coauthor of several books, scripts and articles in italian language, published on a Italian big community named ASPItalia.com. Thanks to these contributions I'm Microsoft MVP since 2004.
