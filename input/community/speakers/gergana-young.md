Gergana Young is a South African software developer, Microsoft MVP, adventurer and Star Wars geek extraordinaire. Intending on making a career of reprogramming astromech droids with JavaScript, she abandoned the Imperial Academy. After many hours spent in the world of .NET, JavaScript, Angular and web components, she finally found her place in the software world. As a co-organiser of the Johannesburg JavaScript user group, Jozi.js, and a MVP in IoT she spends her spare time building cool software for "things". Her favourite area of research is the convergence of the web and Internet-of-Things.
