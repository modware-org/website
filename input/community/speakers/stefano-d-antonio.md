I'm Stefano d'Antonio, but call me Stef.

I have worked in the industry for more than 10 years, my early days were focused on home and conference automation; I enjoyed playing with programmable hardware, but I gradually moved more into software-only roles.

I moved to the UK from Italy and I initially worked as developer, now I'm a full time cloud architect, but I do enjoy writing code (in particular F# or forcing functional paradigm into C#) in my spare time for community projects.

I currently work at Microsoft as a cloud solution architect.

I love Azure, cloud infrastructure and code (and enjoy a casual bit of GCP), especially everything that's .NET.
