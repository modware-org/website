I have already did some presentations in local comunities and my currents responsabilites are pretty much related to present valiable technologic solutions to POs, so i kind need to exercise presentations.  I had the oportunity to participate in the last azure comunity days but i did not manager correctly my time box so that is something useful to know more how to scope presentations a little bit more
