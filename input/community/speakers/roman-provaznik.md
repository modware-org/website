Roman is an F# lead developer, speaker, software architect and the founder of the Czech F#/functional .NET community. He has been developing applications for more than 20 years using languages such as Pascal, Delphi, PHP, C# and F#. With his background of 3 years as a local radio station presenter (which proves IT is not only for introverts), he is always ready to chat about the things he loves: F#, functional programming, domain-driven design, event sourcing systems, web development, and drums. You can often see him hanging around the F# community he helps to maintain and grow.
