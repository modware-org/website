Hi! I'm the author of _Head First C#_, the popular book on learning real-world programming with C# and .NET published by O'Reilly. I've also written several other O'Reilly books, and I've been teaching people about C#, .NET, programming, agile, project management, and lots of other topics. I've been helping people learn C# and .NET for over 15 years, and I'd love to come and talk to you and your organization.

Here's a little more about me. I'm a world-recognized expert in transforming and improving software organizations, teams, and code. I'm an author and international speaker, with top-selling books in software development and project management. I've even been referred to as one of "the industry's best and brightest" (by Dr. Dobb's Journal in 2006).

Things I've done include:
* Writing top-selling books on software engineering, project management, and software development
* Building, managing, and leading large teams of programmers, testers, business analysts, and project managers
* Architecting, designing, and full-stack development of large-scale front-end and back-end systems (in many languages, including C#, Java, Scala, and JavaScript)
* Coaching, consulting, and training agile teams in Scrum, XP, Lean/Kanban
