I'm working as a software architect and have experience in .NET and Microsoft technologies since 2005. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering and have a master's degree focused on Linux. 

I am one of the community leads of msHOWTO, the largest tech community in Turkey, responsible for software development and DevOps stuff. I enjoy organising and speaking at tech events as well. I host a webcast series called "msHOWTO Live!", with the aim of sharing (and learning) knowledge about Azure and other Microsoft Technologies.

I have been awarded Microsoft Azure MVP for 2021â€“2022, Traefik Ambassador since 2020, and July 2020 Cloud Community Champion by Cloud Family as well.
