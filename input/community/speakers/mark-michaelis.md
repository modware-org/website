He is also an adjunct professor at Eastern Washington University, a regular speaker at developer conferences around the world, and has written numerous articles and books, including the seventh edition of [Essential C# 8.0](https://IntelliTect.com/EssentialCSharp), which due out in the fall of 2020.
