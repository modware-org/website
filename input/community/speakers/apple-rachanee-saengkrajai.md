I am just a woman who loves coding. I have been in this field for more than ten years. I focus and be proficient in Microsoft technologies for instance C#, .NET, Azure etc. 
I endeavor to spread my knowledge out to the local communities in Thailand. Eventhough I can speak English, but I believe that sharing in Thai is more effective to reach and onboard local people.
Right now, I am a community leader of the .Net Thailand, we hold many events locally for example, .Net Conf Thailand, .Net Meetup Bangkok etc.
