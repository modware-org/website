Technical Computer Systems Engineer from the Pontifical University of Salamanca, Solutions Cloud Architect at Encamina, 
I have been a Microsoft MVP for 4 years in the category of Visual Studio and Development Technologies. 
I hold various certifications from .NET Framework version 2.0 to the current versio. I have been using and developing with Microsoft products for over 15 years. 
I love participating in projects that have to do with the cloud because for me it is not the future, it is the present of technology. I'm a fan of Apis, WCF services and everything that smells like backend

I contribute to the developers community writing articles, giving speeches in numerous events, helping to translate Microsoft MakeCode and micro:bit, participating and moderating several MSDN forums in Spanish and also collaborate with CompartiMOSS (https://www.compartimoss.com/), a Microsoft technologies specializing magazine.
Currently I'm one of the CrossDvlup community group organizers (https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/CrossDvlup).
