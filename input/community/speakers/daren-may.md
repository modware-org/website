I've always been a developer at heart, although my first profession was as an aviation engineer in the British Royal Navy. I have owned and operated a number of consulting companies - currently I am founder and president of CustomMayd. We design and create developer training and develop Xbox, mobile, desktop and web software for a variety of clients, both small and large. My personal passion is Windows development using UWP and the composition APIs -  I'm especially looking forward to project Reunion and WinUI3. I love sharing my experience and passion for technologies and often present to local user groups as well as create developer and architect training for Microsoft.
 
In my leisure time I exercise, read, and ride my motorcycles in the Colorado mountains.
