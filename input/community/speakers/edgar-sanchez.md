I've had the luck to present live on many occasions through the years to audiences of all sizes: from two or three people to a few thousand. I feel comfortable presenting on developer and BI topics, including DevOps and cloud, and I think I am good at explaining topics new to the attendants. On the other hand, I don't think I have inherent skills far above the average, nor oversized brains 游때, and precisely because of this I think I can relate to the experience of an average developer learning new stuff.
