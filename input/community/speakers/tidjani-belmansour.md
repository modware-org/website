I am a computer enthusiast who wrote his first line of code in 1988, in Basic on a Yamaha MSX (if it reminds you of memories, you just betrayed your age â˜º).

I have been working with Azure since 2009 and I love what the platform has become over the years.

I like to share my knowledge and experiences with you but I also like to learn from yours.
