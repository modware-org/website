My name is Marco and I have an incredible passion for technology which I had the privilege to turn into a job. I've been working with .NET since the first beta, focusing on ASP.NET and, more generally, anything that is web related. I've been an early adopter of Microsoft Azure – who remembers the portal in Silverlight? :) – and, since its introduction, Cloud technologies have represented the core of my professional interest.

Today I work as a freelance Solutions Architect in the beautiful London, focusing on Cloud transformation. Getting involved in the .NET and Azure community is also a key aspect of my profession: I'm convinced that knowledge sharing is one of the best ways to improve our professional skills, and therefore I try to dedicate as much time as I can to activities such as writing articles or speaking at conferences and meetups. Thanks to that, I've been awarded as a Microsoft MVP for the last 11 years in a row.
