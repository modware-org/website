In this workshop, you'll learn by building a full-featured iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows application from scratch built with .NET MAUI. We'll start from File/ New and build up a full application that lists data from a RESTful backend, add navigation, platform features including geolocation, dependency injection, app themeing, and more.
